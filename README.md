# Student-Management-System
You have to write a C program to implement the following console-based mini 
project. 
Project Description: 
The Student Management System is designed to manage the information of students 
within a class. It allows the user to add new student data, display a list of all students, 
search for a student by their roll number or name and calculate the average marks of 
each student. Additionally, the system can display the highest and lowest marks in the 
class. 
Project Features: 
1. Add New Student: 
○ The system should prompt the user to enter details for a new student, 
including: 
■ Student Name (string) 
■ Roll Number (integer) 
■ Marks (float or integer, representing marks in a subject or multiple 
subjects) 
2. View List of Students: 
○ The system should display a list of all students showing their roll number, 
name and marks. 
3. Search for a Student: 
○ Users can search for a student by their name or roll number. 
○ The system should display the student’s details if found or indicate that the 
student is not in the database. 
4. Calculate Average Marks: 
○ The system should calculate the average marks of each student based on 
their scores in different subjects. 
5. Display Highest and Lowest Marks: 
○ The system should determine the highest and lowest marks in the class 
and display them, along with the corresponding student details. 
Concepts Required: 
● Arrays, Loops, If-Else, String
